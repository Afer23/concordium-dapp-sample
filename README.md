# Concordium dApp Sample

This project is a basic example of a decentralized application (dApp) developed for the Concordium blockchain using Rust. The application registers transactions between users on the blockchain, demonstrating key concepts such as smart contract development and blockchain interaction.

## Features
- Register transactions (sender, receiver, and amount) on the Concordium blockchain.
- Retrieve a list of all transactions stored in the smart contract.

## Purpose
This project showcases my ability to develop and deploy smart contracts in Rust, specifically tailored for Concordium's blockchain environment. It highlights my skills in blockchain development, smart contracts, and using Rust for secure and efficient coding.

## Setup Instructions
- The smart contract is written in Rust and is ready for deployment on the Concordium testnet.
- The code includes the necessary logic to manage transaction records securely on the blockchain.
